# Assembler Interpreter
This is a program designed to interpret basic [Assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) code.
## What is an interpreter ?
An interpreter is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions written using one of the many high-level programming languages.
## Visuals
If specified, this program also provides some visuals that follow the calculations that the program makes. In each line, we print the input code together with a star simbol (*) that indicates which line the program is analysing. Below this we print all the registers the program has stored.
